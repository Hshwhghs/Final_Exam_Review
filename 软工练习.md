### 问答题

1.  In a few sentences, try to describe the primary differences between structured analysis 
          and object-oriented analysis.
         **Answer:** Structured analysis begins with a consideration of the data objects that the system must manipulate. In structured analysis the data objects are described with a data dictionary and the entity relation diagram (ERD) depicts relationships between data objects. The flow and transformation of data through a system are represented using the data flow diagram (DFD). The structured analysis also incorporates a behavioral modeling notation called the state transition diagram (STD). In the object oriented analysis model, class-based elements model the objects that the system will manipulate, the operations that will be applied to the objects to effect the manipulation, relationships (some hierarchical) between the objects, and the collaborations that occur between the classes that are defined. In addition the OO model represents the behavior of objects and the behavior of the system as a whole.
